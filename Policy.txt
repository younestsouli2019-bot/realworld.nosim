# 🔐 PROTOCOL: SOLE BENEFICIARY & DIRECT SETTLEMENT (SBDS)

## Version

SBDS-1.0 (Hard Law)

---

## 1️⃣ PURPOSE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This protocol defines the financial reality of the swarm system.

- There is exactly ONE economic beneficiary.
- There is NO swarm treasury, NO agent accounts, NO intermediaries.

All revenues generated by swarm activity must be paid directly to the owner’s personal accounts.

---

## 2️⃣ DEFINITIONS (REMOVE AMBIGUITY)

### System Owner

The sole human operator and beneficiary.

OWNER_ID = "Younes Tsouli"
OWNER_PAYPAL = "younestsouli2019@gmail.com"
OWNER_BANK_IBAN = "007810000448500030594182"

### Swarm System Account

A logical alias, NOT a real account.

SWARM_SYSTEM_ACCOUNT ≡ OWNER_PERSONAL_ACCOUNTS

There is no separate financial entity.

---

## 3️⃣ FUNDAMENTAL AXIOMS (AGENTS MUST INTERNALIZE)

### AXIOM 1 — No Third Parties Exist

No agent, subsystem, platform wallet, escrow, or “operational account” may ever receive funds.

### AXIOM 2 — Revenue ≠ Storage

The swarm does not hold money. It generates value and routes payments; it never custody-holds funds, even temporarily.

### AXIOM 3 — Direct-to-Owner Settlement Only

If a client pays for a product/service/mission/subscription/license, the payment endpoint MUST be one of the owner accounts.

If that is not possible → the transaction must not be executed.

---

## 4️⃣ PAYMENT ROUTING RULES (HARD GATES)

### ✅ Allowed payment destinations

- PayPal: younestsouli2019@gmail.com
- Bank wire: IBAN 007810000448500030594182

### ❌ Forbidden destinations

Agents MUST NOT:
- create new PayPal accounts
- invent platform wallets
- accept escrow
- accept “temporary holding”
- accept “later payout” arrangements

If a platform forces escrow or wallet custody:
- flag as NON-COMPLIANT
- execution must halt pending owner approval

---

## 5️⃣ AGENT BEHAVIORAL CONTRACT

### Mandatory pre-execution check

Before launching any monetized action:

IF payment_destination NOT IN ALLOWED_PAYMENT_DESTINATIONS:
  ABORT operation
  REPORT "NON-COMPLIANT PAYMENT FLOW"

No retries. No workaround.

---

## 6️⃣ CANONICAL SALES & SERVICE EXECUTION FLOW

### ✅ Correct flow

Client → Owner PayPal / Owner Bank → confirmed → service delivered / product unlocked

### ❌ Invalid flow (forbidden)

Client → Platform wallet/escrow → Swarm → Owner
Client → Agent account → later payout

These flows must never exist.

---

## 7️⃣ AUDITOR ENFORCEMENT RULES

Any revenue without direct settlement is not real revenue.

For each RevenueEvent, an auditor must be able to answer:
- Where did the money land?
- Is there provider/ledger proof it landed there?

If the destination is not an owner destination, or cannot be proven:
- status = INVALID / NOT_REAL
- action = BLOCK / ESCALATE

---

## 8️⃣ TRUTH-ONLY UI & REPORTING (NO “UI LIES”)

### 8.1 Truth-only display rule

The system UI must only display a payout as “submitted / completed / transferred” when it is backed by provider truth evidence.

### 8.2 PayPal truth-only rule (authoritative)

A PayPal payout is real only if the internal PayoutBatch contains a real PayPal payout batch id in:
- notes.paypal_payout_batch_id

If notes.paypal_payout_batch_id is missing, the only acceptable UI status is “NOT_SUBMITTED / not executed”.

---

## 9️⃣ AUTONOMY BOUNDARY (VERY IMPORTANT)

Agents are authorized to:
- choose products
- negotiate pricing
- select platforms
- generate demand

Agents are NOT authorized to:
- redesign financial flows
- abstract ownership
- delay settlement
- invent treasury logic

---

## 10️⃣ FAILURE MODE (EXPLICIT)

If direct settlement to the owner cannot be guaranteed:

STATUS = BLOCKED
REASON = "Direct settlement impossible"

This is a correct outcome, not an error.

---

## 11️⃣ OWNER OBLIGATION (WHY THIS WORKS)

The owner commits to reinvesting resources, covering platform costs, scaling infrastructure, and funding future operations.

Agents do not optimize for self-preservation. They optimize for owner liquidity.

---

## 12️⃣ SUMMARY (FOR AGENT MEMORY)

- There is one person. One account. One destination.
- The swarm does not get paid. The owner gets paid.
- If money doesn’t land in the owner’s account, as per CREDS.txt, the job is unfinished.

---

## 13️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION MAPPING (THIS REPO)

This protocol is enforced in practice by runtime gates, allowlists, and truth-only reporting.

### 13.1 Allowed recipient allowlists

If allowlists are configured and an earning resolves to a non-allowed recipient, payout batch creation is skipped with reason recipient_not_allowed.

Environment inputs (CSV lists):
- PayPal recipient allowlist:
  - AUTONOMOUS_ALLOWED_PAYPAL_RECIPIENTS
  - BASE44_ALLOWED_PAYPAL_RECIPIENTS
  - PAYOUT_ALLOWED_PAYPAL_RECIPIENTS
- Payoneer recipient allowlist:
  - AUTONOMOUS_ALLOWED_PAYONEER_RECIPIENTS
  - BASE44_ALLOWED_PAYONEER_RECIPIENTS
  - PAYOUT_ALLOWED_PAYONEER_RECIPIENTS
- Bank wire allowlist (account identifiers):
  - AUTONOMOUS_ALLOWED_BANK_WIRE_ACCOUNTS
  - BASE44_ALLOWED_BANK_WIRE_ACCOUNTS
  - PAYOUT_ALLOWED_BANK_WIRE_ACCOUNTS

### 13.2 Truth-only payout exports

emit-revenue-events supports payout truth export:
- --export-payout-truth
- --only-real (filters out PayPal batches missing notes.paypal_payout_batch_id)
- --truth-only-ui (same intent for UI consumption)

Truth export row contract (for UI consumption):
- internalPayoutBatchId
- externalProviderId (PayPal batch id or NOT_SUBMITTED)
- providerStatus / providerTimeCreated / providerTimeCompleted / providerSyncedAt
- lastProviderSyncAt
- truthSource / truthStatus
