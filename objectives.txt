Autonomous Revenue & Settlement
- Generate revenues autonomously and settle directly to owner accounts
- Enforce owner-only destinations; no intermediaries or platform wallets
- Support multi-route settlement (bank, payoneer, crypto; PayPal gated by geopolicy)

Health & Hardware Resilience
- Produce detailed health failure reports with timestamps and severity
- Identify hardware issues and performance degradations with diagnostics
- Apply mitigation strategies per issue with clear timelines and resources
- Implement power redundancy: auto-failover ≤30s, sufficient runtime, monitoring/alerts
- Document configurations and test results for audit purposes

Resource Scaling & Execution
- Prioritize owner resource scaling operations across available payment routes
- Execute real crypto settlements via Bitget provider to owner crypto address
- Generate alternate routes (bank/payoneer) when viable and compliant

PC Procurement Funding Policy
- Fund PC procurement via swarm-generated revenues or external client payments
- Owner accounts are receive-only; do not use owner accounts to pay vendors
- Record procurement budget, routes, fulfillment, and audit artifacts

Evidence & Governance
- Require MoneyMovedGate and ChainVerifier proof for all revenue events
- Enforce 72h settlement SLA; queue in offline/bunker mode instead of failing
- Apply unit economics guardrail (Net Profit > $5, Margin > 15%)
- Uphold governance gate: intent, power gradient, transparency, autonomy, deadman

Operational Timeline
- Immediate: network reset and diagnostics rerun
- Same day: disk cleanup, system repair (sfc, dism)
- 1–2 weeks: UPS/ATS/generator setup, monitoring integration, failover drills
- Continuous: audit logging, evidence chaining, route optimization, compliance
