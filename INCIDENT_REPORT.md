# 🚨 INCIDENT REPORT: ZERO REVENUE VISIBILITY & EXECUTION HALT
**Date:** 2026-01-01
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** MITIGATED / AWAITING USER ACTION

## 1. Executive Summary
This report details the root cause analysis and resolution of the "Cluster Fuck" incident where revenue visibility dropped to zero and execution stalled. The primary failure was caused by a security lockout on the Base44 platform ("Private App" 403 Forbidden), which prevented the Autonomous Daemon from accessing the ledger and verifying revenue.

**Current State:**
- ✅ **Daemon:** ONLINE (Live Mode)
- ✅ **Resilience:** Offline Fallback Active
- ✅ **Execution:** Real Loop Active (Idea → Offer → Payment)
- ⚠️ **Ledger Access:** RESTRICTED (Requires User Action)

---

## 2. Root Cause Analysis
The investigation identified a single critical failure point:

- **Error:** `403 Forbidden: This app is private`
- **Source:** Base44 API (Service Token Authentication)
- **Impact:**
  1.  The Daemon could not fetch `RevenueEvent` data.
  2.  The "Offline Store" (`.base44-offline-store.json`) was empty because it relies on API sync.
  3.  WebSocket connection failed due to subdomain mismatch (`base44.app` vs `agent-flow-ai...`).
  4.  Result: The system perceived "0 Revenue" because it was blind to the ledger.

---

## 3. Corrective Actions Taken

### A. Offline Resilience Strategy (Implemented)
We have engineered a "bunker mode" for the Autonomous Daemon:
- **Auto-Switch:** If the API returns 403, the Daemon automatically switches to `offline` mode.
- **Persistence:** State is now saved to `.base44-offline-store.json` to survive restarts.
- **Continuity:** Migration batches can now be generated from local data even if the platform is down.

### B. "Full Speed Ahead" Execution Loop (Implemented)
Per your directive, we collapsed the complex Swarm into a ruthless execution pipeline:
1.  **Idea Extraction:** Restored 228 high-value missions from `archive/`.
2.  **Force Offer:** Immediately generates `OFFER_...` references and PayPal Checkout links.
3.  **Live Exposure:** Offers are published to `LIVE_OFFERS.md`.
4.  **Reality Gate:** The system waits for *actual* payment confirmation before proceeding.

### C. WebSocket Repair (Pending)
Identified the connection error in `unstuck.txt`.
- **Fix:** Pointing WebSocket to `wss://agent-flow-ai-9855ea98.base44.app/...` instead of the generic domain.

---

## 4. Immediate User Action Required
To fully restore ledger visibility and allow the Daemon to "see" incoming money:

1.  **Go to Base44 Dashboard.**
2.  **Select App:** `agent-flow-ai` (ID: `6888ac155ebf84dd9855ea98`).
3.  **Settings > Privacy:** Change from **"Private"** to **"Public"** (or "Unlisted").
4.  **Notify Daemon:** Once done, the 403 error will vanish, and the Daemon will sync the ledger.

## 5. Technical Status
| Component | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Autonomous Daemon** | 🟢 RUNNING | PID: `3` (Node.js) |
| **Live Mode** | 🟢 ENFORCED | Sandbox strictly disabled |
| **Revenue Ledger** | 🔴 BLOCKED | 403 Forbidden (See Action Item) |
| **Funds Migration** | 🟡 READY | Waiting for Ledger Sync |
| **Real Execution** | 🟢 ACTIVE | Polling for payments |
