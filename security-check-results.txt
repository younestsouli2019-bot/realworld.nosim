=== SECURITY & CONNECTIVITY REPORT ===
Date: 2026-01-02
Machine: DESKTOP-T3K5RUR
Status: ⚠️ CONNECTION BLOCKED

1. DIAGNOSIS
--------------------------------------------------
[x] Portmaster Firewall detected (Active)
[x] DNS Resolution to 'www.payoneer.com' FAILED (Blocked)
[x] Direct DNS query (8.8.8.8) FAILED (Blocked by Portmaster)
[x] Windows Firewall Active (Normal)
[x] HOSTS file clean (No tampering)

2. ROOT CAUSE
--------------------------------------------------
The application "Portmaster" (Safing) is blocking access to Payoneer.
It is intercepting all DNS requests and failing to resolve 'payoneer.com', likely due to a selected "Privacy Filter" or "Malware Filter" list (Cloudflare Security 1.1.1.2 is active).

3. ACTION REQUIRED (MANUAL FIX)
--------------------------------------------------
Since Portmaster is protecting this machine, you must authorize Payoneer manually:

OPTION A: QUICK FIX (Pause Protection)
1. Find the Portmaster icon in your taskbar (blue shield).
2. Right-click -> "Pause Blocking" (or "Allow All" temporarily).
3. Refresh the Payoneer page in Chrome.

OPTION B: PERMANENT FIX (Allow Rule)
1. Open the "Portmaster" application.
2. Go to the "Monitor" tab (left side).
3. Filter/Search for "payoneer" or "chrome".
4. You will see red "Blocked" connections.
5. Click on the blocked connection and select "Allow" or "Allow Domain".

4. LOGS ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------
System logs confirm 'portmaster.exe' and 'portmaster-core.exe' are enforcing network policy.
DNS requests to external servers (Google 8.8.8.8) are being dropped to prevent leaks.
This confirms the "Blue Screen" or network issues are likely self-inflicted by strict firewall rules.

5. NEXT STEPS
--------------------------------------------------
Once you have allowed Payoneer in Portmaster:
1. Retry the login.
2. Verify the $159.45 transfer.
