## 🛑 STOPPING THE LOOP
The system has been patched to **REJECT** any attempt to route funds through your personal Binance account.
Future settlements will generate **DIRECT PAYMENT LINKS** for clients to pay into your Trust Wallet.

## ✅ NEXT STEPS
1. **Monitor Trust Wallet** for incoming transactions directly from external sources.
2. **Do NOT** use Binance as a bridge.
