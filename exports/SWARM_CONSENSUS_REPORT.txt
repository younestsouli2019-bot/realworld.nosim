RANKING:
1. RealWorldCerts Swarm (Score: 99)
   Reason: Aligns with registered legal entity (Auto-Entrepreneur). Professional, corporate identity. Distances from "freelancer" stigma.

2. Tsouli Holdings Autonomous Unit (Score: 88)
   Reason: Strong, but slightly less market-facing than RealWorldCerts.

3. LazyArk Collective (Score: 45)
   Reason: Sounds too informal/freelance. Deprecated in favor of corporate branding.

VERDICT:
Switch to RealWorldCerts.
System is ready to re-route pending settlements to this new destination.
