Subject: Crypto Settlement Live Rollout — Signature Fix + External Settlement

Summary:
- Settlement route: USDT (BEP20) from Swarm Aggregation Wallet to Owner Trust Wallet (0xA462...fe7)
- Live withdraw path uses Exchange API HMAC-SHA256 signing over sorted query string with server time alignment
- ExternalSettlement recorded in Base44 (idempotent, gated), no private keys used

Operational Steps:
- Set env gates:
  - SWARM_LIVE=true
  - CRYPTO_WITHDRAW_ENABLE=true
  - BINANCE_API_KEY, BINANCE_API_SECRET present
  - BASE44_ENABLE_EXTERNAL_SETTLEMENT_WRITES=true (for Base44 record creation)
- Execute live withdraw:
  - node scripts/execute-crypto-settlement.mjs BATCH_LIVE_1767528254631
  - Behavior: submit withdrawal, resolve txId via history; if pending, logs “submitted” receipt and exits non-zero
- Verify on-chain:
  - ChainVerifier scans BSC for USDT Transfer to Owner Trust Wallet; requires successful receipt.status=COMPLETED_AND_VERIFIED
- Record External Settlement:
  - Dry-run: node src/prepare-external-settlement.mjs --settlement-id BATCH_LIVE_1767528254631 --fixed-amount 850 --fixed-beneficiary 0xA46225a984E2B2B5E5082E52AE8d8915A09fEfe7 --fixed-currency USDT --dry-run
  - Write: same command without --dry-run and with BASE44_ENABLE_EXTERNAL_SETTLEMENT_WRITES=true

Security:
- No private keys are used or stored; receive-only posture enforced
- Strict on-chain verification; no simulated receipts
- If exchange signing fails, process queues and requests manual intervention; no forced spend

Agent Actions:
- Rail Optimizer: prefer bank/payoneer where configured; crypto used for verified destination only
- Mission Consolidator: mark settlement batch mission as completed upon verified tx + external settlement record write
- Health Monitor: alert if submission persists >30 minutes without txId; fallback to manual execution path

References:
- scripts/execute-crypto-settlement.mjs (HMAC signing + server time + withdraw/history)
- src/verification/ChainVerifier.mjs (USDT transfer verification on BSC)
- src/prepare-external-settlement.mjs (fixed-amount Base44 ExternalSettlement write)

Status:
- Ready for live release. Proceed immediately when env gates are set.
