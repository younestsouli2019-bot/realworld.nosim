The system indicates these funds are currently "Held by Platform" in my Global Payment Service receiving account.

- Amount: $1200 USD
- Reference ID: BATCH_PAYONEER_X_1767529200
- Source: Swarm Autonomous Revenue Aggregator (Global Payment Service)
- Status: PENDING / HELD BY PLATFORM

Please confirm when these funds will be released to my available balance for withdrawal.

Best regards,
Younes Tsouli
