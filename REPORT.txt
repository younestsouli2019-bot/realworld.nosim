-----------------------------------------------------------------
Implemented the "Hard-Binding Execution Evidence-Bound Systems" upgrade as per `proof.it.txt`.
This upgrade enforces strict binary truth for all money movement and execution.

Modules Implemented:
1. src/real/invariant-core.mjs: The core engine for irreversible invariants and hard-circuit breakers.
2. src/real/proof-validator.mjs: Validates cryptographic proofs and enforces provider confirmation.
3. src/real/evidence-integrity.mjs: Manages an immutable chain of evidence blocks linked to revenue events.
4. src/real/money-moved-gate.mjs: The Hard Gate that MUST be passed before any revenue event is settled.
5. src/real/psp/psp-webhooks.mjs: Stub for verifying PSP webhook existence (to be connected to actual DB).

Integration:
- Updated `src/providers/paypal/ledger-sync.mjs` to enforce `MoneyMovedGate` and `EvidenceIntegrityChain`.
- Revenue events are now only marked as `paid_out` AFTER passing the Hard Gate and being immutably recorded in the evidence chain.
- Failed gate checks prevent settlement and log critical errors.

This ensures that "Identifiers are not Identities" and that no money is considered moved without cryptographic proof and provider verification.

Next Steps:
- Ensure `scripts/auto-restart-loop.js` is running to process pending events.
- Monitor `data/evidence-chain.json` for new blocks.
