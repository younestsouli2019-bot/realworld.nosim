Subject: Request for API Access (Billing Service) - Account ID: [Your Payoneer Customer ID]

Dear Payoneer Integration Team,

I am writing to request API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) for my business account to automate my billing and payment collection workflows.

My account details are:
- Name: Younes Tsouli
- Email: younestsouli2019@gmail.com

I am building an internal system to automate the generation of "Payment Requests" (Billing Service) for my clients.

Please note:
1. I am the **Owner** of this account.
2. I am **NOT** a Third-Party Provider (TPP) and do **NOT** require Open Banking / PSD2 access.
3. I do **NOT** have an eIDAS certificate, as I am automating my own account, not managing others'.

I attempted to register via the Developer Portal, but it requires an eIDAS certificate. Please enable the standard **Billing Service API** (or Mass Payouts API if required for authentication) for my account so I can obtain my `Client ID` and `Client Secret` without this certificate.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

Younes Tsouli
