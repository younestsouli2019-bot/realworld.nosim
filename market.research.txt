---

## 🧠 **Intelligence Layer Architecture**

### **1. Market Intelligence Agent**
```javascript
// src/revenue/market-intelligence.mjs
- Real-time trend monitoring (Google Trends, Reddit, Pinterest)
- Competitor price tracking across 50+ platforms
- Seasonal demand forecasting (ARIMA + LSTM models)
- Sentiment analysis on product reviews
- Demand score: (trend_velocity * seasonality_factor * sentiment_score)
```

### **2. Product Selection Engine**
```javascript
// src/revenue/product-scoring.mjs
Scoring Algorithm:
Score = (Demand × 0.4) + (Margin × 0.3) + (Seasonality × 0.2) - (Competition × 0.1)

Prioritization Matrix:
┌─────────────────┬───────────────────────┐
│ High Margin     │ High Margin           │
│ Low Demand      │ High Demand           │ ← TARGET
├─────────────────┼───────────────────────┤
│ Low Margin      │ Low Margin            │
│ Low Demand      │ High Demand           │
└─────────────────┴───────────────────────┘
```

## 🏭 **Production Pipeline Agents**

### **3. Supplier Orchestration Agent**
```javascript
// src/revenue/supplier-manager.mjs
- Automated RFQ generation to manufacturers
- Multi-supplier bidding system
- Quality assurance via sample ordering
- Lead time optimization
- MOQ negotiation using historical data
```

### **4. Dynamic Pricing Agent**
```javascript
// src/revenue/pricing-engine.mjs
Pricing Strategy:
Base Price = Cost × (1 + Target_Margin)
Final Price = Base_Price × (1 + Demand_Multiplier) × (1 - Competition_Discount)

Real-time adjustments:
- ±5% daily based on conversion rates
- ±15% seasonal adjustments
- Competitive undercutting (2-5% below average)
```

### **5. Listing Optimization Agent**
```javascript
// src/revenue/listing-optimizer.mjs
AI-generated content:
- GPT-4 generated product titles/descriptions
- A/B testing on 5+ variations
- SEO optimization (keyword density 2-3%)
- Image generation via DALL-E 3 for mockups
- Review synthesis from similar products
```

```

### **8. Inventory Intelligence Agent**
```javascript
// src/revenue/inventory-optimizer.mjs
Stocking Formula:
Reorder_Quantity = (Avg_Daily_Sales × Lead_Time × 1.5) - Current_Stock

Safety Stock = (Max_Daily_Sales - Avg_Daily_Sales) × Lead_Time
Dead Stock Detection: Products with < 2 sales/month trigger clearance
```
