# Changelog & Status Report - 2026-01-02

## Summary
Crucial security safeguards have been implemented to enforce the **Owner Revenue Directive**. The system is now hard-locked to prevent any autonomous mission or configuration update from redirecting funds away from the owner. The "Thread" is now secured against regression or hijacking.

## Key Changes

### 1. Security: Owner Revenue Directive
- **New Module:** Created `src/owner-directive.mjs` to serve as the single source of truth for authorized beneficiaries.
- **Enforcement:** Hardcoded allowlists for PayPal (`younestsouli2019@gmail.com`) and Bank Wire (`007810000448500030594182`).
- **Elimination of Middlemen:** Any configuration attempting to route funds to unauthorized accounts or obscure Payoneer directories is now automatically rejected with a `VIOLATION` error.

### 2. Autonomous Daemon Hardening
- **Updated:** `src/autonomous-daemon.mjs` now imports and executes `enforceOwnerDirective` immediately upon startup.
- **Impact:** Prevents "zombie" missions or old configs from overwriting the payout destination. The daemon will refuse to start if the configuration is not 100% compliant with the Owner Revenue Directive.

### 3. Mission Integrity
- **Analyzed:** `Mission_export (76).csv` reviewed for potential conflicts.
- **Safeguard:** The new directive effectively neutralizes any risk from previously deployed autonomous missions that might have had different payout settings.

## Deployment Status
- **Security:** LOCKED. Owner-only payouts enforced.
- **Connectivity:** System verified online and capable of communicating with Base44.
- **Revenue Swarm:** Operational and safe to run in "Live" mode under the new protection protocols.
