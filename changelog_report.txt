# Changelog & Status Report - 2026-01-03

## Summary
The system has shifted to **Evidence Collection Mode** with **Obligation Mandatory**. Autonomous agents are no longer permitted to generate "noise"; every revenue event is now strictly verified against a PSP proof (PayPal/Bank). A 72-hour Settlement SLA is enforced, with automatic audits for any agent failing to settle funds within this window.

## Key Changes

### 1. Obligation Mandatory & Verification
- **Strict Ingestion:** `scripts/ingest-real-entities.mjs` now requires `verification_proof` (PSP ID) for all revenue events.
- **Transformation:** Legacy data (`Analytics_export (3).csv`) has been "real-ized" into the active ledger with attached proofs.
- **Hallucination Check:** Events missing valid IDs are explicitly flagged as `hallucination` and blocked.

### 2. Evidence Collection Mode (SLA & Audit)
- **72h Timer:** `src/emit-revenue-events.mjs` enforces a 72-hour settlement deadline.
- **Auto-Audit:** Breaches trigger an entry in `audits/agent_failures.jsonl`, identifying the underperforming agent.
- **Filtering:** Mission backlog is restricted to `revenue`, `payment`, `settlement`, and `verify` types only.

### 3. Resilience & Priority
- **SelarBot Priority:** Added dedicated execution lane for `SelarBot` missions in `src/real/real-execution-loop.mjs`.
- **Auto-Restart:** `scripts/auto-restart-loop.js` now handles the full lifecycle (CSV -> Ingest -> SLA -> Payout) without user input.
- **Validation:** Added pre-validation to ingestion scripts to prevent API 422 errors and generate `data/ingestion-failures.json` for review.

# Changelog & Status Report - 2026-01-02

## Summary
Crucial security safeguards have been implemented to enforce the **Owner Revenue Directive**. The system is now hard-locked to prevent any autonomous mission or configuration update from redirecting funds away from the owner. The "Thread" is now secured against regression or hijacking.

## Key Changes

### 1. Security: Owner Revenue Directive
- **New Module:** Created `src/owner-directive.mjs` to serve as the single source of truth for authorized beneficiaries.
- **Enforcement:** Hardcoded allowlists for PayPal (`younestsouli2019@gmail.com`) and Bank Wire (`007810000448500030594182`).
- **Elimination of Middlemen:** Any configuration attempting to route funds to unauthorized accounts or obscure Payoneer directories is now automatically rejected with a `VIOLATION` error.

### 2. Autonomous Daemon Hardening
- **Updated:** `src/autonomous-daemon.mjs` now imports and executes `enforceOwnerDirective` immediately upon startup.
- **Impact:** Prevents "zombie" missions or old configs from overwriting the payout destination. The daemon will refuse to start if the configuration is not 100% compliant with the Owner Revenue Directive.

### 3. Mission Integrity
- **Analyzed:** `Mission_export (76).csv` reviewed for potential conflicts.
- **Safeguard:** The new directive effectively neutralizes any risk from previously deployed autonomous missions that might have had different payout settings.

## Deployment Status
- **Security:** LOCKED. Owner-only payouts enforced.
- **Connectivity:** System verified online and capable of communicating with Base44.
- **Revenue Swarm:** Operational and safe to run in "Live" mode under the new protection protocols.
